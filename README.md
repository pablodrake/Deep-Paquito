# Deep-Paquito

Deep-Paquito is a lightweight deep learning framework developed from scratch in C++. This project is a personal endeavor aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of machine learning and deep learning principles. The framework is intentionally kept small to serve as a learning tool, making it accessible for anyone interested in exploring the inner workings of deep learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Deep-Paquito is designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to easily understand and modify individual components.
  
- **From Scratch Implementation**: Every aspect of the framework, including neural network layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms, is implemented from scratch, providing a hands-on learning experience.

- **C++ Implementation**: The entire framework is written in C++, making it suitable for those who want to enhance their understanding of both deep learning concepts and C++ programming.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deep-Paquito.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   cd Deep-Paquito
   make
   ```

3. **Run Sample Applications:**
   Edit paquito.cpp(main) and make the network using the already provided modules, then execute and include the datasets.
